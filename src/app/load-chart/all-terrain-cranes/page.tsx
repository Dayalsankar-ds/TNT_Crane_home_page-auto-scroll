/**
 * ALL-TERRAIN CRANES — dedicated page for this one crane type, originally
 * one of 6 on the /load-chart overview page (2026-09-29, first added as a
 * pilot for reaching a dedicated inner page from the nav instead of an
 * anchor). /load-chart itself was deleted the same day, on request ("except
 * All-Terrain Cranes page remove all the other individual pages") — this is
 * the only crane-type page the site has now. The other 5 crane-type nav
 * titles (Crawler, Hydraulic Truck, Rough-Terrain, Carry Deck, Tower) were
 * removed in the same edit, then explicitly put back — "keep the title on
 * the nav bar, I ask you to remove the page only" — pointing at
 * EquipmentGuide.tsx's homepage anchors instead of the deleted page. See
 * navigation.ts's "Load Chart" group for the full history.
 *
 * Overview data (name, icon, photo) is still fleetTypes.ts's own FLEET_TYPES
 * entry — the exact same one EquipmentGuide.tsx renders — not a duplicate.
 * Real TNT photography (isRealFleetPhoto: true), so no "Stock photo" tag
 * needed on the hero.
 *
 * REAL ALL-TERRAIN DATA (2026-09-29, on request — "bring all these listed
 * Cranes on that dedicated page"): craneChartData.ts now carries a genuine
 * "all-terrain" class, 46 models, split out of the old catch-all "mobile"
 * bucket by matching make+model against tntcrane.com/crane-charts/'s own
 * live "All-Terrain Cranes" filter (checked directly, 2026-09-29) — not a
 * guess.
 *
 * CARD VIEW, NOT THE DARK CHART (2026-09-29, on request — "remove that dark
 * theme capacity chart, I want card view in light theme"): this page used
 * CraneCapacityChart's navy/amber table at first; swapped for CraneCardGrid,
 * a light-theme card-per-model layout with the same search-by-make/model
 * behavior. CraneCapacityChart.tsx and the homepage modal that used to open
 * it were both deleted later the same day — see EquipmentGuide.tsx's
 * docblock ("'View Full Capacity Chart' popup removed").
 *
 * NO STANDALONE HERO PHOTO (2026-09-29, on request — "there is an image on
 * the top alone remove that"): the page used to also show CRANE_TYPE.photo
 * once, full-width, between the header and the grid. Once every card in
 * CraneCardGrid started showing that same photo as its own thumbnail (see
 * that component's CARD PHOTO note), the standalone copy above the grid was
 * just the same image twice — removed here, kept in the cards.
 *
 * NO "BACK TO LOAD CHART" LINK (2026-09-29, on request — "remove that back
 * arrow"): the header used to open with a `<Link href="/load-chart">` above
 * the eyebrow; removed outright, not just hidden — the top nav's own "Load
 * Chart" menu still reaches /load-chart, so the page isn't a dead end.
 *
 * NO HEADER DIVIDER (2026-09-29, on request — "I can see a line on the page
 * remove that too"): the header `<section>` used to carry `border-b`,
 * drawing a rule under the intro paragraph before the card grid — removed;
 * the two sections' own padding is enough separation.
 *
 * HERO BANNER (2026-09-29, on request — "add background image behind this
 * ... act as a hero banner"): the header is now CRANE_TYPE.photo full-bleed
 * behind the eyebrow/heading/intro, with the same left-to-right dark scrim
 * StorySlideshow.tsx uses over its own photos (`from-black/85 via-black/45
 * to-transparent`) so the now-white text stays readable regardless of what
 * part of the photo sits behind it, without flattening the image under a
 * uniform tint.
 *
 * Stats in the copy (model count, capacity range) are computed from
 * CRANE_MODELS at render time, not hardcoded — they can't drift from the
 * table below them.
 *
 * CARD PHOTO POOL, NOT ONE REPEATED IMAGE (2026-09-29, on request — "add
 * different image on all the cards... don't show the same images"): built
 * here as `CARD_PHOTOS` — the real CRANE_TYPE.photo first, then 5 verified
 * Unsplash photos of genuine all-terrain-class cranes (PHOTOS.allTerrainStock
 * 1–5, sourcing note in photos.ts). Passed to CraneCardGrid as a pool it
 * rotates by card position — see that component's own CARD PHOTO note for
 * why a pool instead of per-model photography.
