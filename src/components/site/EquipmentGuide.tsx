/**
 * ABOUT THE FLEET (2026-09-13, on request) — replaces the "Rigging &
 * Attachments" card-grid + compare-modal section entirely, with content
 * matching tntcrane.com's own "About the Fleet" homepage section, restyled
 * in this site's own type/color system rather than copied verbatim:
 *   - Eyebrow "About the Fleet" + heading "A Modern Fleet of More Than 700
 *     Cranes" (their exact copy)
 *   - Their 6-item crane-type list (All-Terrain, Crawler, Hydraulic Truck,
 *     Rough-Terrain, Carry Deck, Tower)
 *   - Their two closing paragraphs (specialized rigging equipment, then
 *     Machinery Moving / Industrial Storage) as descriptive copy.
 *
 * NO CTA BUTTON — a "Talk to an engineer" button briefly lived here, added
 * on the assumption every section should close with one (the pattern
 * elsewhere on this site). Checked the live section directly: it has no CTA
 * at all — just the two paragraphs, plus inline links on "Machinery
 * Moving"/"Industrial Storage" within the second one pointing at those
 * service pages. Removed to match the actual source rather than an
 * invented convention.
 *
 * SCROLLING PHOTO GALLERY (2026-09-13, on request: "add that images... I
 * prefer scrolling type"): the plain bulleted list is now a horizontal,
 * snap-scrolling gallery of the same 6 crane types — real photography where
 * it exists, a plain gradient+icon tile where it doesn't (see below). Native
 * CSS scroll-snap (`overflow-x-auto snap-x`), no carousel library or client
 * state needed. Text content moved above the gallery (was beside the list
 * in a 2-column grid) since a full-bleed-width gallery and a side column
 * don't coexist — the copy now reads as an intro, the gallery as what it's
 * introducing.
 *
 * SINGLE-PHOTO SLIDESHOW (2026-09-17, on request: "one single image
 * placeholder need to change one by one" — didn't like the 6-card scroll
 * gallery's image placement): replaced the horizontal gallery with one
 * large photo beside a clickable list of the same 6 crane types. The photo
 * crossfades to match whichever type is active; active state both
 * auto-advances (every 4s, on request — "auto-rotate + labels") and can be
 * jumped to directly by clicking a label, same interaction shape as
 * StorySlideshow.tsx's own autoplaying card grid (4s cadence,
 * reduced-motion opt-out, gated on the section being in view — copied
 * rather than reinvented, so the two autoplay features on this page behave
 * identically). Each label keeps the slugified `id` the old cards carried,
 * so navigation.ts's Fleet panel deep links still land on something real.
 *
 * 3 REAL + 3 STOCK, ALL 6 WITH A PHOTO (2026-09-13, same day — a bare
 * gradient tile for 3 of 6 cards read as "missing photos" sitting next to
 * ones that had them, in a gallery where all 6 are visible side by side —
 * on request, made consistent instead): all-terrain, crawler, and hydraulic
 * truck cranes are real TNT photography, downloaded and inspected from
 * tntcrane.com's own homepage (FLEET_PHOTOS in photos.ts has the full
 * sourcing note and file provenance). Rough-Terrain, Carry Deck, and Tower
 * Cranes use verified Unsplash stock instead (PHOTOS.roughTerrainCrane /
 * carryDeckCrane / towerCrane) — genuine photos of that equipment class,
 * just not TNT's own fleet, and not claimed to be. A set of same-named PNGs
 * already existed on disk for exactly these 3 categories; opened and
 * inspected, they turned out to be synthetic/AI-generated (see
 * FLEET_PHOTOS's own docblock) and were left unused rather than reached
 * for — a genuine stock photo beats a fabricated "real" one.
 *
 * Each card keeps its own `id` (slugified) and `scroll-mt-32` so
 * navigation.ts's Fleet panel sub-items still have something real to deep-
 * link to, same pattern the old card grid used.
 *
 * Section keeps `id="fleet-guide"` — navigation.ts's "Fleet" group href
 * still points at it; renaming the anchor would mean touching every place
 * that links to the group, not just this file.
 *
 * LIGHT GREY THEME: shell is `bg-tnt-gray` (#eeeeee — this token's own
 * globals.css comment literally calls it out for "alternating section
 * backgrounds"), not plain white, so this section reads as its own tinted
 * band between the white Full-Scope Capability section above and whatever
 * follows, rather than blending into either.
 *
 * "VIEW FULL CAPACITY CHART" POPUP REMOVED (2026-09-29, on request —
 * "Remove 'FULL CAPACITY CHART' pop up from main screen"): this section used
 * to also have a button opening every model TNT operates, in a modal
 * (CraneCapacityChart.tsx, via the shared capacityChartStore.ts so the Load
 * Chart nav dropdown's CTA could open the same one). Both the button and the
 * modal are gone; the label list above is the section's only interaction
 * now. CraneCapacityChart.tsx and capacityChartStore.ts were this modal's
 * only consumers, so both files were deleted rather than left orphaned —
 * see /load-chart/all-terrain-cranes for where model-browsing now actually
 * lives (CraneCardGrid.tsx, its own light-theme card view).

                (/load-chart/all-terrain-cranes — 46 real models, searchable
                and filterable), so its label is a `Link` there instead of a
