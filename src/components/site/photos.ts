  // ABOUT THE FLEET — Unsplash fallback for the 3 crane types FLEET_PHOTOS
  // has no real TNT photo for (2026-09-13). Checked each returns HTTP 200 /
  // image/jpeg, and viewed each before picking it:
  //   - roughTerrainCrane: a SANY mobile crane's boom/hook/cab close-up —
  //     genuinely a rough-terrain-class crane, not a generic stand-in.
  //   - carryDeckCrane: the closest available match, NOT a precise one —
  //     Unsplash has no real carry-deck-crane coverage (the class is a
  //     low-profile 4-wheel yard crane with no truck cab). This is a
  //     truck-mounted boom crane at a residential job site instead; picked
  //     for being a small, compact mobile crane rather than claiming to be
  //     an exact match.
  //   - towerCrane: a straightforward tower-crane boom against open sky.

/**
 * RIGGING & ATTACHMENTS — real TNT/RMS photography (2026-08-26, correcting
 * the Unsplash-only pass above). Sourced from tntcrane.com and rmscranes.com
 * (RMS Cranes is "A TNT Company") service pages, downloaded and inspected
 * before use:
 *   - hydraulicGantry: TNT-branded hydraulic gantry setting a heavy
 *     concrete/vessel-sized load (tntcrane.com, Gantry_Banner — a wider crop
 *     of the same job CASE_PHOTOS.petrochemicalVesselPlacement uses)
 *   - cantileverSpreaderBar: a TNT-branded cantilever bar rigged off a
 *     crawler crane's hook, lifting flush against a high-rise facade
 *     (tntcrane.com, Rigging_Cantilever_Old_1) — stands in for
 *     below-the-hook lifting devices generally, since a cantilever bar is
 *     one, rather than keeping a separate, less specific Unsplash card for
 *     the same equipment family
 *   - spmtModularTransport: a Goldhofer SPMT hauling a large transformer
 *     (tntcrane.com, Rigging_Goldhofer_SPMT_Transformer_2025_1)
 *   - jackAndSlide: a jack-and-slide operation leveling equipment on skid
 *     rails, RMS-stenciled timber cribbing visible (tntcrane.com,
 *     Rigging_Jacking_Sliding_2025_1)
 *   - versaLiftMachineryMoving: a TNT-branded Versa-Lift moving a
 *     Siemens transformer (tntcrane.com, TNT-Machinery-Moving_Versa-Lift-
 *     25-35_Siemens_2560x1440)
 *
 * NOT included: a photo filed under "…Personnel…" (Rigging_Buda_Manitou_
 * Personnel) turned out to show a Manitou forklift loading HVAC units, not
 * a man-basket/personnel platform — the filename was misleading. Using it
 * under a "Personnel Lift" label would have mislabeled real footage, which
 * is worse than the label not existing, so it was left out rather than
 * force-fit.

 * crane-type gallery in EquipmentGuide.tsx. Sourced directly from
 * tntcrane.com's own homepage/uploads, downloaded and inspected before use,
 * same rigor as RIGGING_PHOTOS above:
 *   - allTerrainCrane: a red TNT-branded all-terrain crane picking in
 *     downtown Houston traffic (tntcrane.com, AT-Crane_TNT-Crane-2)
 *   - crawlerCrane: a TNT crawler crane setting bridge girders over a creek
 *     (tntcrane.com, TNT_Crawler_Union-Pacific)

 *     large pipeline section into place (tntcrane.com,
 *     Water-Pipeline-Project-Hydraulic-Truck-Cranes_1)
 *
 * NOT included: Rough-Terrain, Carry Deck, and Tower Cranes have no found
 * real TNT photo yet — their service subpages didn't surface one on
 * inspection. They use Unsplash fallback instead (PHOTOS.roughTerrainCrane /
 * carryDeckCrane / towerCrane above), same as this project's other catalogs
 * do for categories without real photography — not left bare.

 * A set of same-named PNGs already existed on disk in public/photos/fleet/
 * (all-terrain-cranes.png, crawler-cranes.png, boom-trucks.png,
 * carry-deck-industrial.png, rough-terrain-cranes.png, tower-cranes.png,

 * they're synthetic/AI-generated (uniform 1254×1254 output size, an
 * impossible wet-mirror-floor-at-sunset composition repeated across every
 * one, and a "TNT" logo rendered onto the equipment rather than
 * photographed). Left on disk but NOT referenced by name here — using them
 * would be exactly the kind of fabricated-as-real photo this project's
 * sourcing rule exists to prevent. Flagged for the user; consider deleting
 * them separately since a same-named file sitting unused is an easy trap for
 * a future edit to reach for by mistake.

 * All four sourced from tntcrane.com's own uploads (one, the wind farm
 * erection, from rmscranes.com — RMS Cranes is "A TNT Company"), downloaded
 * and inspected before use, same rigor as the Fleet Guide photos:
 *   - refineryReactorExchange: a Liebherr LR1500 crawler crane rigged at a
 *     refinery/gas-plant site (tntcrane.com, Heavy-Lift_Demethanizer-Lift-1)
 *   - windFarmTurbineErection: two crawler cranes stepping a wind-tower
 *     section into place, blades and nacelle staged nearby (rmscranes.com,
 *     RMS-Cranes-Wind-Tower-Construction)
 *   - bridgeGirderSet: a TNT-branded all-terrain crane setting a girder
 *     over water (tntcrane.com, 900-Ton_Bridge-Girders_2024) — this job
 *     previously had no real photo at all and ran on an Unsplash placeholder
 *   - petrochemicalVesselPlacement: a TNT-branded hydraulic gantry lifting a
 *     vessel-sized load (tntcrane.com, Gantry_Old_1)
 *
 * None is an exact tonnage/technique match for its story's copy (the copy
 * itself is still placeholder narrative per this file's other case-photo
 * notes) — each is a genuine TNT job in the right category (refinery/plant,
 * wind, bridge, gantry), not a fabricated or mismatched stand-in.
 *
 * Local paths, same arrangement as FLEET_PHOTOS: not Unsplash IDs, so these
 * bypass `IMG()` and are sized by `next/image` at the call site.
