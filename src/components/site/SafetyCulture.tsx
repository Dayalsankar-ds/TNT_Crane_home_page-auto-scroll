/**
 * SAFETY CULTURE — iCARE.
 *
 * TNT's safety program, given its own moment right before the homepage's
 * convert beat (CaseStudies "prove it" → this → ContactSection "convert").
 * Same maroon contrast-band pattern ClientSelfService established: the band
 * color itself marks the section, eyebrow + h2 + subline up top, then a
 * supporting row below.
 *
 * Logo: Assets/PNG Logos/iCARE_Badge-Logo (copied to public/brand/icare-badge.png).
 * The Badge variant was used instead of Primary/Secondary because both of
 * those bake "Safety Culture Starts With Me" in as black text on a
 * transparent background — illegible on this section's maroon fill. The
 * Badge is a self-contained shield (works on any background), so the
 * tagline is set here as real text instead, in the site's own type.
 *
 * 2026-07-30: the certification-chip row briefly moved to a new strip right
 * after the hero (CertificationsStrip), to avoid the same five badges
 * appearing twice on one page. That strip couldn't get real, rights-cleared
 * logos for these credentials on short notice (see its own history — moved
 * from fabricated seal art to a "pending" placeholder rather than risk an
 * unverified compliance claim), so the strip was repurposed to show TNT's
 * own Family of Companies logos instead, and the certification chips moved
 * back here — their original, and now only, home.
