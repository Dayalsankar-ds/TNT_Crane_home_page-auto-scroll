/**
 * SMOOTH SCROLL — the animation foundation.
 *
 * Boots Lenis (inertial smooth scroll) and makes GSAP's ticker the single rAF
 * loop that drives BOTH the scroll and every ScrollTrigger animation. Before
 * this, each scroll-reactive piece (hero canvas scrub, nav reveal, count-ups,
 * image reveals) ran its own independent rAF loop reading layout every frame —
 * they competed on the main thread and starved each other mid-animation. From
 * here, new scroll-linked motion should be built on GSAP ScrollTrigger so it
 * shares this one loop instead of adding another.
 *
 * Renders nothing; mount once, high in the tree (root layout).
 *
 * Guards:
 *  - prefers-reduced-motion → Lenis is never started; native scrolling and the
 *    CSS `scroll-behavior: smooth` fallback stay in effect.
 *  - touch (coarse pointer) → smoothing is left to the native momentum scroll,
 *    which already feels right on mobile and avoids fighting the OS. Wheel/
 *    trackpad on pointer devices is where Lenis earns its keep.

 *
 * Null before mount, and null for the whole session under prefers-reduced-

    // Every ScrollTrigger caches its start/end as PIXEL positions when its
    // component mounts (during hydration). But the R3F/WebGL hero and the
    // remote hero/section images finish laying out AFTER that — the hero only
    // takes its full 500vh height once mounted — which pushes the absolute
    // position of every section below it downward. Without a refresh, those
    // triggers keep their stale (too-early) start/end, so a scrubbed section
    // like StatementSection reaches progress 1 within a few px and looks frozen
    // fully-expanded. A single ScrollTrigger.refresh() after layout settles
    // repairs ALL of them at once.
    //
    // A ResizeObserver on <body> catches the exact moment the hero/images
    // change document height (debounced to one rAF); the load + fonts.ready
    // passes cover anything the observer misses. Absolutely-positioned scrub
    // elements (the expanding card, translated titles) don't change body
    // height, so this never feeds back on itself during an animation.
